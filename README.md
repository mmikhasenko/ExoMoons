# Test of Pluto notebooks. Exomoons project

https://mmikhasenko.github.io/ExoMoons/
## Overview
I would like the documentation workflow where the README page is posted as a GitHub / GitLab page, converted to html with pandoc.
Pluto notebooks are converted to html with `PlutoSliderServer`. The index is extracted manually.

The rest of the document should be generated automatically.
